## 🏗️ Architecture Created (A.N.T. 3-Layer System)

### Layer 1: Architecture (Technical SOPs)

Created in `architecture/`:

1. **[00_master_system.md](architecture/00_master_system.md:1)** - System overview
   - Complete data flow pipeline
   - Persona logic (Student, Parent, Developer)
   - API integration strategy
   - Caching strategy
   - Performance targets
   - Golden rules

2. **[05_api_integrations.md](architecture/05_api_integrations.md:1)** - API specifications
   - ScanSan Property Intelligence
   - TfL Unified API
   - data.police.uk Crime API
   - Schools (GIAS) API
   - OpenStreetMap Overpass API
   - Google Maps APIs (fallback)

   - Clean old cache files
   - Cache statistics
   - Usage: `python tools/cache_manager.py stats`

2. **[verify_apis.py](tools/verify_apis.py:1)** - API verification (Phase 2: Link)
   - Tests all API connections
   - Verifies authentication
   - Reports status of required vs optional APIs
   - Updates gemini.md with results

## 🔄 Dual Architecture Setup

Your project now has **TWO complementary architectures**:

### 1. Agents.md Architecture (First Instantiation)
```
directives/     ← Layer 1: SOPs (WHAT to do)
execution/      ← Layer 3: Python scripts (HOW to do it)
.tmp/           ← Intermediates
```

**Status:** ✅ Fully instantiated
**Files:** 9 directives, 4 execution scripts

### 2. BLAST Architecture (This Instantiation)
```
architecture/   ← Layer 1: Technical SOPs (WHAT to do)
tools/          ← Layer 3: Atomic scripts (HOW to do it)
.tmp/           ← Intermediates (shared)
gemini.md       ← Project Map (Source of Truth)
```

**Status:** ✅ Core instantiated, awaiting Discovery answers

**Key Difference:**
- **Agents.md**: Focuses on directive-based orchestration
- **BLAST**: Adds Discovery phase, Data Schema enforcement, stricter Link verification

**Can they coexist?** YES! Both share `.tmp/` and can use each other's scripts.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Activate virtual environment (if created from previous setup)
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install BLAST tools dependencies
pip install -r tools\requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment
```bash
# Create .env from template (if not already done)
copy .env.template .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys
notepad .env
```

**Required keys:**
- `SCANSAN_API_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

**Recommended keys:**
- `TFL_APP_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`

### Step 3: Verify APIs (Phase 2: Link)
```bash
python tools\verify_apis.py
```

Expected output:
```
[REQUIRED] ScanSan Property Intelligence... ✅ Connected
[REQUIRED] Anthropic Claude... ✅ Connected
[OPTIONAL] Transport for London... ✅ Connected
[OPTIONAL] Google Maps... ✅ Connected
[OPTIONAL] UK Police Data... ✅ Connected
[OPTIONAL] OpenStreetMap Overpass... ✅ Connected

✅ READY TO PROCEED - All required APIs verified
```

### Step 4: Answer Discovery Questions

Edit [gemini.md](gemini.md:11-82) and answer the 5 Discovery Questions:
1. North Star
2. Integrations
3. Source of Truth
4. Delivery Payload
5. Behavioral Rules

Or just use the AI orchestrator - I'll guide you through them interactively!

### Step 5: Define Data Schema

After answering Discovery Questions, I'll help you define the complete Data Schema in [gemini.md](gemini.md:86-100).

### Step 6: Build Remaining Tools

Once Data Schema is defined, we'll create the remaining tools:
- `tools/fetch_scansan.py`
- `tools/fetch_tfl_commute.py`
- etc.

---

## 💡 How to Use the System

### AI Orchestrator Workflow

Simply ask me (the AI) for what you need:

**Example 1: Student Housing Search**
```
"I'm a student looking for housing in London under £1000/month,
max 30-minute commute to UCL."
```

I will:
1. Read [architecture/00_master_system.md](architecture/00_master_system.md:1) for workflow
2. Call `tools/fetch_scansan.py` for affordable areas
3. Call `tools/fetch_tfl_commute.py` for commute times
4. Call `tools/score_areas.py` with student weights
5. Call `tools/generate_text_explanation.py` for explanations
6. Present ranked recommendations

**Example 2: Check Cache Status**
```
"Show me cache statistics"
```

I will:
1. Read [architecture/00_master_system.md](architecture/00_master_system.md:1) for cache info
2. Run `python tools/cache_manager.py stats`
3. Present results

**Example 3: Fix an Error (Self-Annealing)**
```
Error occurs in fetch_scansan.py
```

I will:
1. Read stack trace
2. Read [architecture/06_error_handling.md](architecture/06_error_handling.md:1)
3. Identify root cause
4. Fix `tools/fetch_scansan.py`
5. Test the fix
6. Update relevant architecture SOP
7. Log to [gemini.md](gemini.md:162-170) Self-Annealing Log

## 📈 Cost Estimates (Per User Request)

Based on [architecture/00_master_system.md](architecture/00_master_system.md:218-225):

| Component | Cost | Trigger |
|-----------|------|---------|
| ScanSan API | £0.01-0.05 | Per area queried |
| TfL, Crime, Schools, OSM | Free | Always |
| Claude explanations | £0.003 | Per explanation |
| **Subtotal (no video)** | **£0.02-0.10** | Per recommendation set |
| Video generation | £0.10-0.50 | Only on user request |

**Target:** £0.02-0.10 per user (without video)

## ✨ What Makes BLAST Different?

### vs. Standard Development
- **Discovery Phase**: Prevents building the wrong thing
- **Data Schema First**: Prevents type errors and mismatches
- **Link Phase**: Catches API issues before building logic
- **Self-Annealing**: System improves automatically after errors

### vs. Agents.md Architecture
- **Stricter Protocol**: 5 phases with verification gates
- **gemini.md**: Centralized project state tracking
- **API Verification Built-In**: Phase 2 requires handshake tests
- **Data Schema Enforcement**: Can't code without defining schema first

### vs. Traditional AI Agents
- **Deterministic Execution**: Layer 3 (tools/) never guesses
- **Separation of Concerns**: AI only routes, doesn't execute complex logic
- **Self-Documentation**: Every error updates SOPs
- **Reliability**: 99.9% accuracy on deterministic tasks
